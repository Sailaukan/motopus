# Motopus - AI-Powered Motion Design Animation Generator

Welcome to **Motopus**, the cutting-edge web application designed to generate stunning motion design animations using the power of AI. Leveraging advanced technologies and state-of-the-art tools, Motopus enables users to create high-quality 2D animations effortlessly.

## Features

- **Customizable Components**: Define your animation sequences with customizable components to suit your needs.
- **Real-time Preview**: Instantly preview your animations in real-time before finalizing them.

## Technology Stack

Motopus is built using a robust and modern technology stack to ensure high performance, scalability, and ease of use:

- **Next.js**: A powerful React framework for building fast and scalable web applications.
- **TypeScript**: A superset of JavaScript that adds static typing, ensuring code reliability and maintainability.
- **AWS Lambda**: Serverless computing service for running code in response to events, providing scalability and cost-efficiency.
- **Remotion Library**: A React library for creating animations and videos programmatically.
- **Claude 3.5 Sonnet API**: An advanced AI API for generating content based on user prompts.
- **Tailwind CSS**: A utility-first CSS framework for building custom designs without writing custom CSS.

## How It Works

1. **User Input**: Enter your prompt describing the desired animation.
2. **AI Processing**: The AI, powered by Claude 3.5 Sonnet API, processes the input and generates JSON commands for the animation.
3. **Rendering**: The JSON commands are parsed and converted into TypeScript code using Remotion library components.
4. **Preview**: The animation is rendered and previewed in real-time within the web app.
5. **Export**: Once satisfied with the preview, the animation can be exported and shared on social networks or other platforms.
